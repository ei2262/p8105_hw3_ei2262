### How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most ordered from?

There are 134 aisles. The aisles that were ordered from the most are

### Plot: Displaying the number of items ordered in each aisle

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle, add_to_cart_order) %>% 
  mutate(
    orders = aisles > 10000
  ) 
```

### Table: Three post popular items in “Baking Ingredients”, “Dog Food Care”, and “Packaged Vegetable Fruits” aisles

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle, add_to_cart_order) %>% 
  instacart[which(instacart$aisles == "baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetable fruits")]
```

# Problem 1 Solution

#### Read in the data

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

#### Answer questions about the data

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each row
resprenting a single product from an instacart order. Variables include
identifiers for user, order, and product; the order in which each
product was added to the cart. There are several order-level variables,
describing the day and time of the order, and number of days since prior
order. Then there are several item-specific variables, describing the
product name (e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department (e.g. dairy and eggs,
produce), and aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits), and whether the item
has been ordered by this user in the past. In total, there are 39123
products found in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct users.

Below is a table summarizing the number of items ordered from aisle. In
total, there are 134 aisles, with fresh vegetables and fresh fruits
holding the most items ordered by far.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

Next is a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle.
Here, aisles are ordered by ascending number of items.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_ei2262_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="90%" />

Our next table shows the three most popular items in aisles
`baking ingredients`, `dog food care`, and `packaged vegetables fruits`,
and includes the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |

| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

Finally is a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week. This
table has been formatted in an untidy manner for human readers. Pink
Lady Apples are generally purchased slightly earlier in the day than
Coffee Ice Cream, with the exception of day 5.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  spread(key = order_dow, value = mean_hour) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

# Problem 2

##### Load, tidy, and wrangle `accel_data.csv`

``` r
accel = read_csv("accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    week_day = case_when(
      day == 'Saturday' | day == 'Sunday' ~ 'weekend',
      day != 'Saturday' | day != 'Sunday' ~ 'weekday'
    )) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("activity_"),
    names_to = "activity",
    values_to = "counts",
    names_prefix = "activity_"
  ) %>% 
  select(week, day_id, day, week_day, everything())%>%
  mutate(day = fct_relevel(day, "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday")) %>% 
  arrange(week, day)
```

    ## Rows: 35 Columns: 1443
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr    (1): day
    ## dbl (1442): week, day_id, activity.1, activity.2, activity.3, activity.4, ac...
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

In the `accel` dataset, there are 50400 rows and 6 columns. Columns
`week`, `day_id`, `day`, and `week_day` identify the week and day the
accelerometer data was collected for the 63-year-old male with a BMI 25.
`activity` represent the minute the data was collected and `counts`
represent the “activity counts” for each minute the accelerometer data
was collected. For each day of each week in the `accel` dataset, there
are 1440 observations because there are 1440 minutes in a 24-hour
period.

##### Total Activity Over the Day

``` r
accel %>% 
  group_by(day_id, day, week) %>% 
  summarise(
    total_activity = sum(counts)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(day = fct_relevel(day, "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday")) %>% 
  arrange(week, day) %>% 
  select(week, day, total_activity, day_id) %>% 
  kable() 
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'day_id', 'day'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

I created a table that shows the `total_activity` for each day for each
week data was collected.

Looking at the table created, there is no apparent trends across the 5
weeks. For `day_id` 24 (Saturday) and `day_id` 31 (Saturday), the counts
add up to 1440. It is possible that there was error in collecting the
data during these two days.

##### Plotting 24-hour activity

``` r
accel %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = activity, y = counts, color = day)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank()) +
  labs(title = "24-hour activity time courses for each day",
    x = "minutes",
    y = "activity counts")
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_ei2262_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="90%" />

Based on the graph created, there aren’t any apparent patterns that
appear. Majority of the data lies between 0 - 2500 counts. There are a
few days that the participant had counts over 5000, which were mostly
seen on weekdays. The participant may have had more activities that were
carried out on these days, such as work or doctor appointments. There is
also a dip in the middle of the graph that represents activity counts
less than 2500. It may be worth exploring the isolated drop in activity
counts. The participant may have been restricted to bedrest due to his
health or there may have been error in data collection.

# Problem 3

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("ny_noaa")
```

### *Description*

The `ny_noaa` dataset has 2595176 rows and 7 columns. A large majority
of observations for the variables `prcp`, `snow`, `snwd`, `tmax`, and
`tmin` are *N/A*. Due to this large number of *N/A* observations, it may
be difficult to obtain interpretable measurements from the dataset. The
`id` variable represents the different weather station IDs. However, the
way `id` is currently makes it difficult to know which weather station
each observation is related to.

##### Data Cleaning

``` r
library(lubridate)
```

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'lubridate'

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    ## 
    ##     date, intersect, setdiff, union

``` r
nynoaa_clean = ny_noaa %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = "%m-%d-%y")) %>%
  separate(date,c('year', 'month', 'date'),'-') %>% 
    mutate(
    month = as.integer(month),
    month = month.name[month]
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    tmax = as.numeric(tmax)*.1,
    tmin = as.numeric(tmin)*.1,
    prcp = prcp*.1,
    snow = snow/25.4,
    snwd = snwd/25.4
  )
```

To clean up the data, the variables `tmax` and `tmin` were converted to
numeric variables. `prcp` was converted to mm, which is the unit
precipitation is generally measured. `snow` and `snwd` were converted to
inches, which is the unit snowfall and snow depth is measured in the
United States. `tmax` represents maximum temperature and `tmin`
represents minimum temperature, both in degrees Celsius.

##### Most Common Observations of Snowfall

``` r
nynoaa_clean %>% 
  count(snow) %>% 
  arrange(-n) %>% 
  slice(1:5)
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 2
    ##     snow       n
    ##    <dbl>   <int>
    ## 1  0     2008508
    ## 2 NA      381221
    ## 3  0.984   31022
    ## 4  0.512   23095
    ## 5  2.01    18274

The most commonly observed values for `snowfall` are 0 mm and *N/A*. The
*N/A* observations may be due to the fact that each weather station
collected a subset of the variables listed in the `ny_noaa` dataset. The
0 mm reported snowfall values may be due to the months between January
1, 1981 through December 31, 2010 that did not see any snow. One reason
may the presence of other seasons during data collection. We would not
typically see snow during the Spring, Summer, and Fall. Another reason
may be that there was not a lot of snowfall during the Winter months
during data collection. It is more common to see a few days of snowfall
during the Winter months.

##### Two-panel plot showing the average **max** temperature in January and in July in each station across years

``` r
nynoaa_clean %>%
  group_by(month, year, id) %>% 
  filter(month == "January"| month == "July") %>%
  summarise(
    tmax_avg = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = tmax_avg, group = id)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(.~month)+
  labs(title = "Average Max Temperature in January and July in each weather station (1981 to 2010)",
       x = "Years (1981 - 2010)",
       y = "Average Max Temperature (in degrees C)")
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'month', 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

<img src="p8105_hw3_ei2262_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="90%" />
From the two-panel plot, we observe that July had higher average maximum
temperatures (in degrees C) than January. There is an outlier in July
where the average temperature dropped below 20 degrees C, which is much
colder than what would be expected in July. Overwall, this the graph
represents what would be expected with lower average maximum
temperatures in January compared to July.

##### Two-panel plot showing (i) `tmax` vs `tmin` (ii) distribution of snowfall vlaues greater than 0 and less than 100 separately by year

``` r
tmin_tmax_plot =
  nynoaa_clean %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax, color = year)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

snowfall_plot = 
  nynoaa_clean %>% 
  filter(0 < snow & snow < 100) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = snow)) +
  geom_density(aes(color = year), alpha = 0.4) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
  

tmin_tmax_plot / snowfall_plot 
```
